What is CRUD?
CRUD Meaning: CRUD is an acronym that comes from the world of computer programming and refers to the four functions that are considered necessary to implement a persistent storage application: create, read, update and delete. 

CREATE
The create function allows users to create a new record in the database. In the SQL relational database application, the Create function is called INSERT. 

READ
The read function is similar to a search function. It allows users to search and retrieve specific records in the table and read their values.

UPDATE
The update function is used to modify existing records that exist in the database. To fully change a record, users may have to modify information in multiple fields.

DELETE
The delete function allows users to remove records from a database that is no longer needed.
